X11::Protocol, version 0.03

Copyright (C) 1997 Stephen McCamant. All rights reserved. This program
is free software; you can redistribute and/or modify it under the same

less restrictive copying policy; see that file for details).

Module list information:123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 12345
X11::Protocol	adpO	Raw interface to X Window System servers
X11::Keysyms	adpf	X11 key symbols (translation of keysymdef.h)
X11::Auth	adpO	Read and handle X11 '.Xauthority' files

X11::Protocol and the related modules in this distribution are a rough
equivalent of Xlib (libX11.a, with a bit of Xau and Xext mixed in)
used for drawing windows on and otherwise manipulating X11 window
servers.

OTHER THINGS YOU NEED

* perl 5.002	(not tested recently; 5.004 is recommended)

* an X11 server (any version; it also doesn't have to be on the same
		 computer, but you must be able to connect to it
		 over a socket)

* documentation about the X protocol (or at least Xlib)
O'Reilly has a good book, and the full X distribution includes the
definitive specification (see ftp://ftp.x.org/, or the xbooks package
for Debian Linux users)

	 *********************** NOTE ***********************

* This module's interface is admittedly a little cumbersome, but its low
level approach is intentional -- the author is working on a
higher-level interface, which will be more object-oriented and easier
to use, and allow this low level to eventually be replaced by an XS
interface to Xlib. Send email if you want to alpha-test or contribute.

* This is an alpha release, so the interface is subject to change. This
means that you should tell the author if you find some part
particularly ugly, but you also shouldn't start any large projects
using this module without being prepared to change in the future.

BUILDING

Like any other module:
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

DOCUMENTATION

See the PODs at the end of each .pm file (converted into man pages by
the makefile) for detailed information.

EXAMPLES

test.pl is a good example of a complete program; it's also a
translation of an Xlib based program (in this case, `basicwin' from
O'Reilly & Associates's _Xlib Programming Manual_).

eg/teletype.pl shows how it's possible to connect to more than one
server at once (needs IO::Select).

eg/anim.pl demonstrates buffered animation, and is just generally
cool (needs IO::Select).

eg/full_test.pl uses just about every request in the protocol. You
probably shouldn't run it, since it can do weird things to your
display, but it can show prototype calls if the documentation is
unclear.
