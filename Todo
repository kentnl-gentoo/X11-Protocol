* Save caller info so that protocol errors give useful tracebacks (use
  Carp::longmess?)

* Use (Self|Auto)Loader to reduce startup time; would require major
  restructuring

* Documentation needs more examples, better explanations. Borrow text
  from official protocol spec?

* Real test suite

Porting:
	64-bit architectures?
	avoid '/' as path separator; use File::something?

Extensions:
	Done by Jay Kominek, http://www.miranda.org/~jkominek/perlwm/,
	get his permission to include?
		XC-MISC (get list of rsrc ids from server)
		DPMS
		XFree86_Misc
	Others:
		MIT-SCREEN-SAVER
		MIT-SHM?
		MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD
		Multi-Buffering
		SYNC
		X3D-PEX
		XIE
		XTEST
		Display Postscript?
		OpenGL??

Authentication protocols:
	XDM-something
	SUN-DES-1
	MIT-KERBEROS-5

Other modules:
	X11::Xlib -- XS to libX11.a
		Ken Fox has done this as part of X11-Motif, calling it
		X11::Lib.
	X11::Display, X11::Window, X11::GC, etc -- more OO, more
		intuitive interace, could be on top of Xlib
		(was in progress, now abandoned)

Long-term goals:
	Widget library
	Perl window manager:
		See PerlWM, http://www.miranda.org/~jkominek/perlwm/

If you have something you think should go on this list, or if you want
to work on one or more of the above, I'd be happy to hear from you at
<SMCCAM@cpan.org>.
